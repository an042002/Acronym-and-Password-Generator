# Acronym-and-Password-Generator
This code creates a Acronym and Password of a given text using GUI
the String generator class is the basic logic for creating acronym and passowrd.
The TestGUIApplication uses Objects to use StringGenerator class logic and getting inout from the GUI.
You can improve the code by using your own logic and make changes if you want.
The generatePassword class, if there is uppercase: 'B', 'H' it changes to '3' and '#' respectively & if there is lower case: 't', 'l' then it changes to : '+' and '!', respectively.
For generateAcronym class, it searches forr the first letter in the word and capitalizes it using if and else-if conditions.
The classes are working well.
